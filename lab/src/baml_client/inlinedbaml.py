It is a spin-off of the Final Fantasy series and the first game in the Mana series. \n    Originally developed under the name Gemma Knights, it features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda, but with the addition of role-playing statistical elements. A remake, Sword of Mana, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003, changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which improved the graphics and music of the original version. A third remake, Adventures of Mana, was released for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita on February 4, 2016.\n    The story follows the hero and the heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series.\n    Final Fantasy Adventure was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the Mana series, which became a successful video game role-playing franchise. Its sequel, Secret of Mana, was released in 1993.\n\n    Output:\n    {\"entities\":[{\"name\":\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"type\":\"Game\"},{\"name\":\"Square\",\"type\":\"Publisher\"},{\"name\":\"Game Boy\",\"type\":\"Console\"},{\"name\":\"The Legend of Zelda\",\"type\":\"Game\"},{\"name\":\"Sword of Mana\",\"type\":\"Game\"},{\"name\":\"Game Boy Advance\",\"type\":\"Console\"},{\"name\":\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"type\":\"Game\"},{\"name\":\"Adventures of Mana\",\"type\":\"Game\"},{\"name\":\"PlayStation Vita\",\"type\":\"Console\"},{\"name\":\"Secret of Mana\",\"type\":\"Game\"}],\"triples\":[[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"known in Japan as\",\"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"known in Japan as\",\"Seiken Densetsu\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"European title\",\"Mystic Quest\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"release year\",\"1991\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"genre\",\"action role-playing game\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"developer\",\"Square\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"publisher\",\"Square\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"platform\",\"Game Boy\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"spin-off of\",\"Final Fantasy series\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"is first game in\",\"Mana series\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"original development name\",\"Gemma Knights\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"gameplay similar to\",\"The Legend of Zelda\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"gameplay feature\",\"role-playing statistical elements\"],[\"Sword of Mana\",\"is remake of\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Sword of Mana\",\"platform\",\"Game Boy Advance\"],[\"Sword of Mana\",\"release year\",\"2003\"],[\"Sword of Mana\",\"changed plot from\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Sword of Mana\",\"changed gameplay aspects from\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"is remake of\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"platform\",\"mobile phones\"],[\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"release region\",\"Japan\"],[\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"improved graphics of\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Unnamed Japanese Mobile Remake\",\"improved music of\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"is remake of\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"platform\",\"iOS\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"platform\",\"Android\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"platform\",\"PlayStation Vita\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"release date\",\"February 4, 2016\"],[\"Adventures of Mana\",\"release year\",\"2016\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"story features\",\"hero and heroine\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"antagonist\",\"Dark Lord of Glaive\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"antagonist\",\"Julius\"],[\"Dark Lord of Glaive\",\"assistant is\",\"Julius\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"story objective\",\"prevent destruction of Tree of Mana\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"features elements from\",\"Final Fantasy series\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"features\",\"chocobos\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"later incorporated elements from\",\"common enemies of Mana series\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"later incorporated elements from\",\"gameplay style of Mana series\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"reception\",\"generally positive reviews at release\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"rated by reviewers as\",\"one of the best action adventure games on Game Boy\"],[\"Final Fantasy Adventure\",\"spawned series\",\"Mana series\"],[\"Mana series\",\"is\",\"successful video game role-playing franchise\"],[\"Secret of Mana\",\"is sequel to\",\"Final Fantasy Adventure\"],[\"Secret of Mana\",\"release year\",\"1993\"]]}\n\n    # Input\n    Article:\n    {{ article }}\n\n  \"#\n}\ntest metadata_extraction {\n  functions [ExtractArticleMetadata]\n  args {\n    article #\"\n      Mario Kart 7 is a 2011 kart racing video game developed by Nintendo EAD in cooperation with Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS.
